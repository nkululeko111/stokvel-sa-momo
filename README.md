# MoMo Stokvel+

MoMo Stokvel+ is a digital stokvel management platform built on the **MoMo OpenAPI**.  
It modernizes South Africa’s traditional stokvel culture by enabling communities to **save, invest, and rotate money securely** in a fully transparent way.


## 🌍 Problem
Stokvels are the backbone of African community finance, with millions of members across South Africa.  
But most stokvels still operate **manually or via WhatsApp**, leading to:
- Missed contributions
- Fraud and mismanagement
- No transparency for members
- Inconvenience of cash handling


## 💡 Solution
MoMo Stokvel+ digitizes stokvel operations:
- Members set up stokvel groups with **start/end dates** and agreed **monthly contributions**.
- Supports **different stokvel types**:
  - **Savings stokvel** → pooled funds are shared in December or used for bulk purchases.
  - **Rotational stokvel (umshayelwano)** → members receive the full pot on a rotating basis.
  - **Investment stokvel** → pooled funds invested in property, shares, or projects.
- **Automated debit orders** via MoMo → no chasing members for payments.
- **Transparency dashboard** for all members → who paid, balance, upcoming payouts.
- **Voting system** for group decisions on how funds are used.
- Funds locked in a secure MoMo “stokvel wallet” to prevent misuse.
